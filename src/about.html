                        <p>Respect, trust, fairness, embrace differences, sharing and supporting, improvement. Our values is what we think everyone should be based on. They are also what we use to benchmark our actions. We want everyone respected as a person, having them trusted, treated in a fair manner. We want to have equality in value while understanding the differences - we think that using different mindsets together delivers way better quality. We want information to be shared and colleagues to be supported, all for the purpose of continuous improvement.</p>

                        <p>Equality and diversity in STEM regardless of gender. This is the world we are dreaming of. A world where women don’t have to give 120% to be taken full. A world where men and women are working together in exploring science, developing technology, construct engineering and building a mathematical foundation. A world where the choice of a specific major in studying is not a question of gender. We might often talk about men and women, but we are aware of the wider range which exists, the specific views of cis- and transgender people, the aspects of non-binary and of agender persons. A career or education choice in STEM has to be independent of gender identity.</p>

                        <p>Anja decided to launch Women Techmakers in Hamburg in October last year. Because she wanted to found her own tech startup she participated the tech meetup scene and was shocked about the not existing diversity. She decided to do something, reached out to Google and here we are today. She has a background in business informatics. She was responsible for transforming processes with the help of information systems in companies like Lenovo and Tchibo before she decided to start with her own company Fashion Fellows. She loves to travel and lived some to time in Israel and the United States and knows how inspiring startup eco systems can be like.</p>
